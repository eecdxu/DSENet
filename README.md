# DSENet for Apnea Detection

### Overview

**DSENet** (A **D**ual-**S**tream **E**ncoder-based **Net**work) is a transformer-based model designed for the detection of sleep apnea.
By leveraging advanced neural network architectures, DSENet analyzes nasal pressure from polysomnography to identify apnea events in individuals, 
helping with early diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea.

### Installation

To install DSENet, simply clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/eecdxu/DSENet.git
cd DSENet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the dependencies, you can use DSENet for apnea detection by running the following command:

```
bash MESA_nasal_pressure.sh
```
